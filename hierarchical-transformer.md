# Hierarchical Transformer in AHIP

## Overview

The Hierarchical Transformer is a core component of our Adaptive Hierarchical Image Parser (AHIP), designed to process multi-scale visual features and construct a hierarchical representation of the image content. It builds upon the success of transformer architectures in capturing long-range dependencies while incorporating novel elements to handle the multi-scale nature of visual information.

## Architecture

1. Input: Multi-scale feature maps from the CNN backbone (typically 3 scales: fine, medium, coarse)

2. Scale-specific Transformers:
   - Each scale has its own transformer encoder
   - Architecture: Similar to the original transformer, but with 2D positional encodings
   - Number of layers: 6 per scale
   - Hidden dimension: 512
   - Number of heads: 8

3. Cross-scale Attention Mechanism:
   - Allows information flow between different scales
   - Implemented after every two layers of scale-specific processing

4. Hierarchical Pooling:
   - Progressively pools information from finer to coarser scales
   - Uses learnable pooling kernels

## Detailed Components

### Scale-specific Transformer

For each scale s:

1. Input: Feature map X_s of shape (H_s, W_s, C)
2. Add 2D sinusoidal positional encodings
3. Reshape to sequence: (H_s * W_s, C)
4. Process through 6 transformer encoder layers:
   - Multi-head self-attention
   - Feed-forward network
   - Layer normalization and residual connections

### Cross-scale Attention

Between scales s_i and s_j:

1. Query: From scale s_i
2. Key and Value: From scale s_j
3. Attention weights: softmax(Q * K^T / sqrt(d_k))
4. Output: Weighted sum of values
5. Aggregate: Concatenate outputs from all scales and project

### Hierarchical Pooling

To pool from scale s to s+1:

1. Apply learnable 2D convolution with stride 2
2. Aggregate: Weighted sum of pooled features and original features at scale s+1

## Training Objectives

1. Primary: Cross-entropy loss for object classification and segmentation
2. Auxiliary: 
   - Reconstruction loss: Decode features back to image space
   - Consistency loss: Ensure consistency between scales

## Innovations

1. Scale-adaptive Attention:
   - Attention weights are modulated by scale difference
   - Allows the model to focus on relevant scales for each task

2. Hierarchical Position Encoding:
   - Encodes both absolute position and scale information
   - Helps maintain spatial relationships across scales

3. Dynamic Scaling:
   - Number of scales can be adjusted at inference time
   - Allows for computational efficiency on different devices

## Benefits

1. Multi-scale Processing: Captures both fine-grained details and global context
2. Hierarchical Understanding: Naturally builds a hierarchical representation of image content
3. Flexibility: Can handle varying image sizes and aspect ratios
4. Efficiency: Parallel processing of different scales

## Challenges and Future Work

1. Computational Complexity: Scaling to very high-resolution images
2. Interpretability: Understanding cross-scale attention patterns
3. Dynamic Architectures: Adapting the architecture based on image content

The Hierarchical Transformer forms the backbone of our system's ability to understand images at multiple levels of abstraction, crucial for building a rich, hierarchical representation of visual content.
