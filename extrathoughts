Adaptive Scale Selection:
Consider implementing a mechanism to adaptively select the most relevant scales for different inputs or tasks. This could potentially improve efficiency and performance.
Memory Efficiency:
Processing multiple scales simultaneously can be memory-intensive. You might want to explore gradient checkpointing or other memory optimization techniques for scaling to larger datasets or higher resolutions.
Few-Shot Adaptation:
The current implementation focuses on classification. Consider extending it to include the few-shot adaptation mechanism mentioned in the design documents, perhaps using prototypical networks or MAML.
Neurosymbolic Reasoning:
While not implemented in the current code, adding a neurosymbolic reasoning layer as described in the design doc could significantly enhance the system's capabilities for complex visual reasoning tasks.
Implicit Neural Representation:
Integrating an implicit neural representation module could allow for more flexible and continuous representation of image content, as suggested in the design.
Visualization and Interpretability:
Adding visualization tools for the multi-scale features and attention patterns could provide valuable insights into how the model is processing information across scales.
Benchmarking:
It would be interesting to compare this model's performance against other state-of-the-art architectures on standard benchmark datasets beyond CIFAR-10.
